# visual-resume
A clean, concise way to view the history and skills of people.

The purpose is to condense all useful information about a person, including where/when they've been,
what skills they have, when they developed them, and how good they are at those skills.
Eventually, a meteor app will be written around it, which will allow creation of new profiles.
It of course will be interactive, since it is in javascript.
